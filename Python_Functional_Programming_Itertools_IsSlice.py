# Python Functional Programming Modules / itertools.
# Functions creating iterators for efficient looping
# This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs 
# from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.
# The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful 
# by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an �iterator algebra� making 
# it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
# itertools.islice(iterable, stop) 
# itertools.islice(iterable, start, stop[, step])
# Make an iterator that returns selected elements from the iterable. 
# If start is non-zero, then elements from the iterable are skipped until start is reached. 
# Afterward, elements are returned consecutively unless step is set higher than one which 
# results in items being skipped. If stop is None, then iteration continues until the iterator 
# is exhausted, if at all; otherwise, it stops at the specified position. 
# Unlike regular slicing, islice() does not support negative values for start, stop, or step. 
# Can be used to extract related fields from data where the internal structure has been 
# flattened (for example, a multi-line report may list a name field on every third line). 
# Roughly equivalent to:

def islice(iterable, *args):

    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2) --> A B
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, 4) --> C D
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 2, None) --> C D E F G
    # islice('ABCDEFG', 0, None, 2) --> A C E G
    s = slice(*args)

    start, stop, step = s.start or 0, s.stop or sys.maxsize, s.step or 1
    it = iter(range(start, stop, step))

    try:
        nexti = next(it)

    except StopIteration:

        # Consume *iterable* up to the *start* position.

        for i, element in zip(range(start), iterable):
            pass
        return

    try:
        for i, element in enumerate(iterable):
            if i == nexti:
                yield element
                nexti = next(it)

    except StopIteration:

        # Consume to *stop*.

        for i, element in zip(range(i + 1, stop), iterable):
            pass
