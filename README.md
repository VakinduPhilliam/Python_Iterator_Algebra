Python Iterator Algebra
This set of scripts is written to demonstrate the usage of Python Functional Programming Modules / itertools. 
Itertools are functions used for creating iterators for efficient looping. 
The itertools module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML. 
Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python. 
The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination. 
Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
