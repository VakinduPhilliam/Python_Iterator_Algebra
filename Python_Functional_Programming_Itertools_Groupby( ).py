# Python Functional Programming Modules / itertools.
# Functions creating iterators for efficient looping
# This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs 
# from APL, Haskell, and SML. Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.
# The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful 
# by themselves or in combination. Together, they form an “iterator algebra” making 
# it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.
# The groupby() iterator is roughly equivalent to:
 
class groupby:

    # [k for k, g in groupby('AAAABBBCCDAABBB')] --> A B C D A B
    # [list(g) for k, g in groupby('AAAABBBCCD')] --> AAAA BBB CC D
